Actions describe events that have occurred in the app and are sent (or "dispatched") to the Redux store to indicate that something should change in the state.

 export default todoSlice.reducer       //* A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as arguments, and returns a new state. Itâ€™s called a reducer because it reduces many actions into a single new state object.
